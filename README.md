# 1.WeatherCycle: Your Ultimate Cycling Companion

## Inspiration 🌞🚴‍♀️
If you are Living in a city with unpredictable weather patterns. Whether it was chilly mornings or sudden downpours, I wished for a way to receive timely weather updates and make informed decisions about  cycling plans. This sparked the idea for WeatherCycle, an app that could provide real-time weather insights tailored to cyclists.

## Learning and Building Process 🌦️🔧
To bring WeatherCycle to life, this  project uses the power of weather data and user-friendly interface. I integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch accurate weather information based on user-provided location. Using Python, I built a script that not only retrieves weather data but also assesses whether the current conditions are suitable for cycling.

I learned a great deal about API integration, data parsing, and making informed decisions based on data. By using Python's requests library, I was able to interact with the API and extract relevant information about temperature, weather conditions, and wind speed. This data formed the basis for determining whether it's a good time to go cycling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- requests library (install using `pip install requests`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WeatherCycle.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd WeatherCycle`

### Usage
1. Get your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
2. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the script with your actual API key.
3. Run the script: `python weather_cycle.py`
4. Enter a city name and country code when prompted (e.g., "New York, US").
5. Receive cycling-friendly weather recommendations.

## Future Enhancements 🚀
While WeatherCycle's current version provides valuable weather insights for cyclists, I have exciting plans for future enhancements. I aim to incorporate more customization options, such as specifying temperature preferences and wind tolerance levels. Additionally, I plan to develop a user-friendly web interface and mobile app to make WeatherCycle accessible on various devices.

## Conclusion 🌈🚵‍♀️
WeatherCycle has been a rewarding project that combines my passion for coding with my love for cycling. The experience taught me valuable skills in API integration, data handling, and user interface design. I'm excited to continue improving WeatherCycle and provide fellow cyclists with a reliable tool for planning their rides. With WeatherCycle, you'll never miss out on a perfect cycling day again!

 ## 2. SQL_Todo-list: Simplifying Task Management

### Inspiration 📋✅

Balancing multiple tasks can be challenging, and I wanted a simple yet efficient solution for task management. SQL_Todo-list was born from this need, aiming to streamline the task organization process.

### Learning and Building Process 📊🛠️

For SQL_Todo-list, I leveraged SQLite to create a database-driven task management system. I learned how to design and structure a relational database to store task data. By utilizing SQL queries, I implemented features like adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.

This project enhanced my understanding of databases, SQL, and their practical applications. I learned how to create, modify, and retrieve data within a database context.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `sqlite3` library (built-in with Python)

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SQL_Todo-list.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd SQL_Todo-list`

#### Usage
1. Run the script: `python todo_list.py`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, complete, or delete tasks.

### Future Enhancements 🚀

While SQL_Todo-list offers core task management capabilities, I plan to enhance it by adding user authentication and more advanced filtering options. I also aim to develop a user-friendly graphical interface to enhance user experience.

### Conclusion 📝✨

SQL_Todo-list allowed me to dive into the world of databases and SQL. This project honed my skills in database design, SQL queries, and practical implementation. As I continue to expand its capabilities, SQL_Todo-list will become an even more robust tool for effective task management.
